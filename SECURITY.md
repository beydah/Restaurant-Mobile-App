# üîê Security Policy

This document provides the security guidelines for the **Restaurant-Mobile-App** project.  
It aims to ensure user data protection, secure app operations, and resilience against potential attacks.

## ‚úÖ Basic Security Practices

### 1. Secret Management
- **API Keys and Passwords:** Never store API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information in plain text in the source code. Use a secure secrets management tool like [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).
- **Environment Variables:** Store secrets in `.env` files and ensure they are included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

### 2. Dependency Management
- **Update Dependencies:** Keep all dependencies up-to-date and regularly check for known vulnerabilities. Tools like [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) can help automate this.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools such as [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/) to scan for security issues in dependencies.

### 3. Data Security
- **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data both in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest (AES-256 or equivalent).
- **Access Control:** Restrict access to user data using the principle of least privilege; only authorized users should have access.

### 4. Authentication and Authorization
- **Strong Authentication:** Use strong user authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Authorization Checks:** Ensure users can only access resources and perform actions they are authorized for.

### 5. Application Security Testing
- **Static and Dynamic Analysis:** Perform regular static and dynamic security testing based on [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MASTG)](https://github.com/OWASP/masvs).
- **Penetration Testing:** Conduct penetration tests to identify potential security vulnerabilities.

### 6. Secure Protocols
- **TLS/SSL:** Ensure all data transmission uses TLS/SSL encryption.
- **Secure API Communication:** Use secure methods like OAuth 2.0 for API authentication and authorization.

### 7. Security Updates and Monitoring
- **Stay Updated:** Regularly update the application and all associated systems with security patches.
- **Monitoring & Alerts:** Implement monitoring and alert systems to detect and respond to security incidents.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Secret Leakage:** Exposing secrets in source code or version control poses serious risks. Always handle secrets securely.
- **Security Reporting:** The project encourages responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities through a dedicated communication channel.
